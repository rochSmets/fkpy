This small repo is a support for the training class **"Fluid & Kinetic Description of Plasmas"**.

The `operationOnDistribution.py` files contains a class definition, which is the main object you will manipulate.

The notebook `momentsFromDistributions.ipynb` contains everything... which means :
* some manipulations to get familiar with the way to calculate moments of a distribution function and their expected values
* some more questions you should try to answer before running the code in order to experience your intuitions
